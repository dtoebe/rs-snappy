# Rs-Snappy
_Cross platform build system to create snappy packages on other distros and possibly other OS' for the Ubuntu Snappy-Core platform with Docker_

I was originally going to build this in Golang, but decided this was a good project to learn and dive into Rust.

### Build Instructions:

* None as of yet

### Todo:

- [ ] snapcraft cmd
    - [x] init
    - [ ] build
    - [ ] other commands
- [ ] Change permissions of snapcraft.yaml (set as root:root from docker)

_will build out more as I come across it_

### Contributions:

As of right now I am using this project to learn Rust.  Any Suggestions on how to better implement something please create an issue explaining what to do, and why.

Once this project becomes more mature I will outline contributions.
